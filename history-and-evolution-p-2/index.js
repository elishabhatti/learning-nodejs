// history and evolution
// javascript initial role: initially javascript was only used for client side-tasks in 
// web browser

// creation of node.js (2009): Ryan Dhal created node.js by taking the v8 engine (usei in google chrome)
// and running in outisde the browser this innovation allowed javascript to handle server side development

// introduction to modules: node.js came with built in modules like http which made it poopular for creating
// backend applications.

// npm(2010): node.js lanched its package manager (npm) is 2010 revoultinging javascript development by 
// simplying  package sharing and dependency management.

// io.js and node.js merger (2015): in 2015 node.js merged with io.js reuning th ecosystem and bringing in the community-driven improvement

// node.js foundation(2015): the node.js foundation was estabilishes to support collabration, innovation and sustainable
// development within the ecosystem.

// Some Famous npm Packages
// Express.js: A popular framework for building web applications and APIs.

// Mongoose: A package for interacting with MongoDB databases using an
// object data modeling (ODM) approach.

// Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

// React (and React-DOM): Though originally developed for the browser, React
// can be installed via npm for building modern web applications.

// Socket.IO: Enables real-time communication between clients and servers.

// merger of node.js and io.js:
// io.js was a fork of Node.js created by developers who wanted faster
// updates and improvements. The merger brought io.jsâ€™s community-driven
// innovations back into the main Node.js project.
// The actual merger took place in September 2015, resulting in the release
// of Node.js v4.0. This version combined the best features of both projects,

// including V8 ES6 support from io.js, and marked the beginning of a Long-
// Term Support (LTS) release cycle for Node.js.
 
// This ensured faster progress, stability, and a unified ecosystem for
// developers.

// Prerequisites to Learn Node.js
// html css and 
// the most important is js basic to intermediate es6 and above

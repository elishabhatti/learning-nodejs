// introdunction to repl:
// it stand for read-eval-print-loop or read evalute print and loop. its and 
// interactive programming environement that allows you to execute javascript
// code one statement at a time. just like you are using code editor
// console.log("Hello World!")

// simply write node in terminal and 
// you can use it to test simple javascript code similar to browser devtools

// you can use it to test simple javscript code simplilar to browser devtools.
// Ctrl + C to exit out of it.

// each part of the acronym highlights a specific step in how the repl works:

// Read: The REPL reads the userâ€™s input (a single line or multiple lines of code) and
// parses it into a data structure that the JavaScript engine can understand.
// Eval (Evaluate): The parsed input is evaluated (executed) by the JavaScript engine. If
// the input is a valid expression, the REPL computes the result.
// Print: The result of the evaluated expression is printed back to the console so the user
// can see the output.
// Loop: The process then loops back, waiting for the next input, and continues until the
// user exits.

// node js is an open source server side javascript runtime allows
// you to run javascript on your machine
// built on the v8 js engine for speed
// robust ecosystem with npm.

// open source
// open source means that the soucrce code is publicly available
// of node js
// anyone can:
    // view
    // modify
    // contribute

// cross platform:
// cross platform means node js can run on mutiple operating system 
// without needing the major changes 
// like
    // mac, windows and linux

// js runtime environment:
// js runtime environment refers to the enviroment where javascript code 
// runs
// n browser: Js typically runs in the browser like chrome, firefox
// to handle frontend tasks

// with node.js
// node hs allows javascript to run outside the browser on the server
// it provides tools to interact with the system like.
// file system (read/ write file)
// network (handle HTTP request)
// database (connect to database like mondoDB or MySql)

// why node.js special as a runtime
// v8 engine
// v8 engine node.js uses google chrome v8 engine to compile js into machine code
// making it ligthing fast

// built in API's:
// node js comes with built in apis like fs for file system for http for servers
// do you can build powerful applications wihtout extra libraries

// why do we need node.js
// single language for full stack development
// developers can use javascript for both frontend and backend also reduces complexity
// for example MERN Stacj project uses JS

// high performance
// thanks to the v8 engine node.js is super fast it can handle thousands of simultaneous 
// connections with ease

// event driven and non blocking I/O:
// unilke traditional servers that blocks a thread fot each request node.js uses an 
// asynchronous model making it higly effiecient for handling multiple tasks.

// scalable for modern appilcations:
// ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, streaming platforms or online games.

// where is node.js used
// exaple of companies
// netflix: for faster straming experience
// linkedIn: their backend uses node.js to handle massive amounts of data
// paypal: for realt-time tractions and ensure scalibility
// Uber: for real-time driver and rider data sycong
// trello: for managing asynchronous updates in real time boards

// is it a language or a framework

// node.js is not a programming language or a framework but rather a javascript runtime environment
// that allows developer to run javascript outside the browers
